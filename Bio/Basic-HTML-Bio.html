    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <p>
        I enjoy watching baseball, hanging with my dogs, reading a book, or watching a movie. I have worked at BSN Sports for the past three years assisting seven sales reps. I am currently in a DataScience Bootcamp, as I am looking for a career change. I'm interested
        in pursuing a career in Data Analytics.

    </P>

    <p>
        Previous to working at BSN Sports, I got my degree in Economics from Texas Christian University, with a minor in Political Science. My senior year of school, I interned for the Texas Governor's re-election campaign. After graduation I accepted a position
        on the campaign and worked on it for a few months.
